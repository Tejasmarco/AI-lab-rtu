1. Object Detection using OpenCV

✦ What is it?

Object detection is the process where a computer "sees" an image or video and identifies objects like people, cars, animals, etc.

✦ Tools & Technologies:

OpenCV: A library used for image and video processing.

MobileNet SSD: A pre-trained AI model that recognizes 80 common objects.

COCO dataset: A large set of images used to train the model.


✦ How it works:

1. The webcam or phone camera provides a live video.


2. Each frame is passed to the AI model.


3. The model detects objects and their positions.


4. Boxes and labels are drawn on the video.



✦ Applications:

Security systems (CCTV)

Self-driving cars

Retail customer analytics

✅ 2. Heart Disease Prediction using Streamlit and ML

✦ What is it?

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease using health data.

✦ Tools Used:

Logistic Regression: A machine learning model used for prediction.

Streamlit: Creates a user interface for the app.

Pandas: Used to handle data in table form.

Joblib: Saves and loads the trained model.


✦ Input Features:

Age, gender

Blood pressure

Cholesterol

Exercise levels


✦ Output:

The system gives either High Risk or Low Risk with a confidence score.


✦ Real-Life Use:

Helps doctors in early diagnosis

Used in healthcare monitoring systems

✅ 3. Social Media Recommendation System

✦ What is it?

A recommendation system suggests posts or videos that users may like, based on what they or others have interacted with.

✦ Techniques:

Collaborative Filtering: Suggests posts liked by similar users.

Cosine Similarity: Measures how similar two users are based on their ratings.


✦ How it works:

1. Collect user-post ratings.


2. Create a user-post matrix.


3. Find similar users.


4. Recommend posts the target user hasn’t seen but similar users liked.



✦ Examples:

Instagram: Reels based on likes

YouTube: Video suggestions

Netflix: Movie recommendations

✅ 4. Facial Recognition using OpenCV

✦ What is it?

Facial recognition is used to identify a person using their face image.

✦ Tools:

OpenCV: For image processing.

LBPH Algorithm: Used to extract facial features and recognize them.

Grayscale Images: Simpler and faster for face detection.


✦ Steps:

1. Create a dataset of face images.


2. Train the recognizer with labeled data.


3. Predict the label for a new test image.



✦ Uses:

Attendance systems

Mobile phone unlocking

Surveillance cameras

✅ 5. AI Virtual Tutor using Hugging Face + Wikipedia

✦ What is it?

A chatbot that answers students' academic questions using AI and Wikipedia.

✦ Components:

Hugging Face Transformers: For Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Wikipedia API: To fetch topic summaries.

Streamlit: For building a simple web app.


✦ How it works:

1. Student types a question.


2. AI searches Wikipedia for relevant content.


3. A pre-trained model (DistilBERT) answers the question.


4. The answer is shown in the app.



✦ Benefits:

Acts like a virtual tutor.

Useful for self-learning and revision.

Available anytime for students.
